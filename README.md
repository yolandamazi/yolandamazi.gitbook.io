### — what's my purpose?

Documenting what I’m actively learning and building as I grow through my journey in cybersecurity and engineering. Right now, I’m focused on studying for cybersecurity certifications, strengthening my technical foundations, and developing the hands-on skills needed in the security field. I will write about the certificates I’m pursuing, the concepts I’m studying, the tools I’m practicing, and my progress as I train to become better at solving machines and understanding systems more deeply. This helps me stay consistent, reflect on my growth, and keep a clear record of everything I learn as I continue developing in the cybersecurity world.
