### — what's my purpose?

Documenting what I’m actively learning and building as I grow through my journey in cybersecurity and engineering. Right now, I’m focused on studying for cybersecurity certifications, strengthening my technical foundations, and developing the hands-on skills needed in the security field. I will write about the certificates I’m pursuing, the concepts I’m studying, the tools I’m practicing, and my progress as I train to become better at solving machines and understanding systems more deeply. Additionally, I’ll track my language studies, including reinforcing my English skills and learning French as a new language. This helps me stay consistent, reflect on my growth, improve my language skills, and keep a clear record of everything I learn as I continue developing in the cybersecurity world.

### — behind the writing

You might notice I switch between Spanish and English across the blog. There’s no specific reason for this. There are some topics I simply feel more natural to write in one language or the other. I hope this won’t get in the way of understanding the information I’m sharing!
