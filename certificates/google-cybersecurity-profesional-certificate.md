I’ve already completed the first three courses, which are:

* Foundations of Cybersecurity
* Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks
* Connect and Protect: Networks and Network Security

For the remaining courses, I’ll keep track of my learning through the blog, documenting the notes I consider important or relevant.

### \[Course 4] Tools of the Trade: Linux and SQL

#### 4.1 Introduction to OS

**Definitions:**

* **OS (Operating System)**: the interface between the computer hardware and the user
* **Legacy Operating System**: an OS that is not up to date while is still in use from a user. Might be vulnerable to new threats
* **Basic Input/Output System (BIOS):** a microchip that contains loading instructions for the computer and is prevalent in older systems. It's activated when you boot your computer. Standard chip since 2007.
* **Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI):** a microchip that is activated when you boot your computer and contains loading instructions for the computer and replaces BIOS on more modern systems. Mostly used on new computers.
* **Bootloader**: a software program activated by the last instruction of the microchip during the computer’s boot process. It is responsible for starting the operating system.
