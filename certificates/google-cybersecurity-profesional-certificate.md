# Google Cybersecurity Profesional Certificate

To get hands-on experience in cybersecurity, I’ve enrolled in the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. My goal is to learn the basics through this course before deepening my skills.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2026-02-10 115806.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

I’ve already completed the first three courses, which are:

* Foundations of Cybersecurity
* Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks
* Connect and Protect: Networks and Network Security

For the remaining courses, I’ll keep track of my learning through the blog, documenting the notes I consider important or relevant.

## 4. Tools of the Trade: Linux and SQL

### 4.1 Introduction to OS

* **OS (Operating System)**: the interface between the computer hardware and the user
* **Legacy Operating System**: an OS that is not up to date while is still in use from a user. Might be vulnerable to new threats
* **Basic Input/Output System (BIOS):** a microchip that contains loading instructions for the computer and is prevalent in older systems. It's activated when you boot your computer. Standard chip since 2007.
* **Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI):** a microchip that is activated when you boot your computer and contains loading instructions for the computer and replaces BIOS on more modern systems. Mostly used on new computers.
* **Bootloader**: a software program activated by the last instruction of the microchip during the computer’s boot process. It is responsible for starting the operating system.
* **Virtual Machine (VM)**: is a virtual version of a physical computer. There are machines that don’t exist physically, but operate like they do because their software simulates physical hardware.
  * Some benefits include improved _security_ due to its isolated environment, as well as increased _efficiency_, since you can streamline multiple tasks across different machines.
* **Virtualization:** process of using software to create virtual representations of various physical machines.
* **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: a user interface that uses commands to interact with the computer
* **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: a user interface that uses icons on the screen to manage different tasks on the computer

### 4.2 The Linux OS

* **Kernel**: a component of the Linux OS that manages processes and memory. The shell processes commands and outputs the results.
* **Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS):** component of the Linux OS that organizes data. It specifies the location where data is stored in the operating system.
* **Central Processing Unit (CPU):** a computer’s main processor, which is used to perform general computing tasks on a computer. It executes the instructions provided by programs, which enables these programs to run.
* **Random Access Memory (RAM):** a hardware component used for short-term memory. It’s where data is stored temporarily as you perform tasks on your computer.
* **Hard drive**: a hardware component used for long-term memory.
* **Package**: a piece of software that can be combined with other packages to form an application. It contains the files necessary for an application to be installed including dependencies, which are supplemental files used to run an application.
* **Package managers:** is a tool that helps resolve any issues with dependencies and perform other management tasks such as install, manage, and remove packages or applications.&#x20;
  * Different package managers typically use different file extensions. For example:
    * _Red Hat Package Manager (RPM)_ has files which use the .rpm file extension, such as Package-Version-Release\_Architecture.rpm.
    * _Debian-derived_ Linux distributions, such as dpkg, have files which use the .deb file extension, such as Package\_Version-Release\_Architecture.deb.
* **Advanced Package Tool (APT)  :** a tool used with Debian-derived distributions. It is run from the command line interface to manage, search, and install packages.
* **Yellowdog Updater Modified (YUM)**  : a tool used with Red Hat derived distributions. It is run from the command line interface to manage, search, and install packages and it works with .rpm files.
*

### 4.4 Databases and SQL
